# A project made using React + Vite
# <h1>By Soumya Sourav Guha</h1>

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

 In the first part, Navigation Component is rendered

 In the second part, Hero component is rendered

 In the third part, Card component is made.This the most typical part.

 However, footer component is ready, yet not rendered as styling is to be done. 

 Repo is open to students for styling.
